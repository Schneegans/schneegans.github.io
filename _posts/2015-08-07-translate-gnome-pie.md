Translating Gnome-Pie just became much easier! Read on to discover how you could contribute to Gnome-Pie!

## The old way

Until now Gnome-Pie [used some scripts]({% post_url 2011-11-09-translate-gnome-pie %}) to generate and update new translations. This had been quite cumbersome and needed replacement. I discovered [Zanata](https://translate.zanata.org/zanata/) and decided to give it a try. Lets see how it works!

## The new way

[Zanata](https://translate.zanata.org/zanata/) is a web-based system which helps translating software projects. I created a [project page for Gnome-Pie](https://translate.zanata.org/zanata/iteration/view/gnome-pie); so you can create a new translation or update an existing one easily. I will be happy to include your new translation into the next version of Gnome-Pie!
