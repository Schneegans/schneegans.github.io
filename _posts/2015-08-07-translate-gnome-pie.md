## Translating with Zanata

[Zanata](https://translate.zanata.org/zanata/) is a web-based system which helps translating software projects. I created a [project page for Gnome-Pie](https://translate.zanata.org/zanata/iteration/view/gnome-pie)! You can use this website to create a new translation or update an existing one. I will be happy to include your new translation into the next version of Gnome-Pie!
