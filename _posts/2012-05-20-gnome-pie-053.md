There didn't change much (yet).

<!--more-->

But the French locale got updated (thanks Mathilde!) and there was a major bug which prevented the auto-start option to work at all (thanks to barteltm for pointing at this issue!). Additionally I implemented a popup window requesting the statistics file from you (as [described earlier]({% post_url 2012-05-10-help-baking-pies %})).

All remaining known bugs will be fixed in the next version! (Including drag'n'drop of Slices from one Pie to another and binding Pies to the super-key).

I'm looking forward to your statistics files!
