Everybody loves badges. With GitHub actions you can even create dynamic badges which change with every commit. In this guide I will show you how!

## The Goal

For the [README.md of Fly-Pie's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Schneegans/Fly-Pie) I wanted to have badges which show the current lines of code and the percentage of comment lines.
These numbers can change very frequently, so I needed **a system for dynamic badges without polluting my git history**. 
And here is the result:

![loc](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Schneegans/8f6459c2417de7534f64d98360dde865/raw/loc.json)
![comments](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Schneegans/8f6459c2417de7534f64d98360dde865/raw/comments.json)

These badges will always show the current numbers and can be embedded everywhere, also in the `README.md` of GitHub!
In this post I will show you how these badges are created.

## 1. Calculate the Lines of Code

First you will need a script which calculates the number of code lines and comment lines for your project.
I have created the script below which you may use as a starting point for your project.
It uses the awesome [`cloc`](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) commandline tool, hence it can be adapted for [almost all programming languages](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc#recognized-languages-).

{% highlight bash linenos %}
#!/bin/bash

# This scripts counts the lines of code and comments in all source files
# and prints the results to the command line. It uses the commandline tool
# "cloc". You can either pass --loc, --comments or --percentage to show the
# respective values only.
# Some parts below need to be adapted to your project!

# Get the location of this script.
SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "$0" )" && pwd )"

# Run cloc - this counts code lines, blank lines and comment lines
# for the specified languages. You will need to change this accordingly.
# For C++, you could use "C++,C/C++ Header" for example.
# We are only interested in the summary, therefore the tail -1
SUMMARY="$(cloc "${SCRIPT_DIR}" --include-lang="JavaScript" --md | tail -1)"

# The $SUMMARY is one line of a markdown table and looks like this:
# SUM:|101|3123|2238|10783
# We use the following command to split it into an array.
IFS='|' read -r -a TOKENS <<< "$SUMMARY"

# Store the individual tokens for better readability.
NUMBER_OF_FILES=${TOKENS[1]}
COMMENT_LINES=${TOKENS[3]}
LINES_OF_CODE=${TOKENS[4]}

# To make the estimate of commented lines more accurate, we have to
# subtract any copyright header which is included in each file.
# For Fly-Pie, this header has the length of five lines.
# All dumb comments like those /////////// or those // ------------ 
# are also subtracted. As cloc does not count inline comments,
# the overall estimate should be rather conservative.
# Change the lines below according to your project.
DUMB_COMMENTS="$(grep -r -E '//////|// -----' "${SCRIPT_DIR}" | wc -l)"
COMMENT_LINES=$(($COMMENT_LINES - 5 * $NUMBER_OF_FILES - $DUMB_COMMENTS))

# Print all results if no arguments are given.
if [[ $# -eq 0 ]] ; then
  awk -v a=$LINES_OF_CODE \
      'BEGIN {printf "Lines of source code: %6.1fk\n", a/1000}'
  awk -v a=$COMMENT_LINES \
      'BEGIN {printf "Lines of comments:    %6.1fk\n", a/1000}'
  awk -v a=$COMMENT_LINES -v b=$LINES_OF_CODE \
      'BEGIN {printf "Comment Percentage:   %6.1f%\n", 100*a/(a+b)}'
  exit 0
fi

# Show lines of code if --loc is given.
if [[ $* == *--loc* ]]
then
  awk -v a=$LINES_OF_CODE \
      'BEGIN {printf "%.1fk\n", a/1000}'
fi

# Show lines of comments if --comments is given.
if [[ $* == *--comments* ]]
then
  awk -v a=$COMMENT_LINES \
      'BEGIN {printf "%.1fk\n", a/1000}'
fi

# Show precentage of comments if --percentage is given.
if [[ $* == *--percentage* ]]
then
  awk -v a=$COMMENT_LINES -v b=$LINES_OF_CODE \
      'BEGIN {printf "%.1f\n", 100*a/(a+b)}'
fi
{% endhighlight %}

Save this as `cloc.sh` in the root directory of your repository and make it executable:

{% highlight bash %}
$> chmod +x cloc.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Then, when you execute the script, it will show you the number of code lines, comment lines and the percentage of comment lines.

{% highlight bash %}
$> ./cloc.sh 
Lines of source code:    4.2k
Lines of comments:       1.3k
Comment Percentage:     32.1%
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
$> ./cloc.sh --loc
4.2k
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
$> ./cloc.sh --percentage
32.1
{% endhighlight %}

## 2. Use the Dynamic Badges Action

Next you have to setup a workflow which creates badges based on these numbers.
To allow this, I have created [a GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dynamic-badges) which can be used to **create arbitrary badges for your README.md from within a GitHub Actions Workflow**.
This action creates a JSON description of the badge and uploads it to a gist.
This JSON description can then be used with [shields.io/endpoint](https://shields.io/endpoint) to create the final badge.

Please [read the configuration instructions](https://github.com/Schneegans/dynamic-badges-action/#configuration) of the Dynamic Badges Action.
You will have to create a public gist and add a secret to your repository allowing the action to push to this gist.

Below you will find an exemplary workflow which will execute the `cloc.sh` script on each commit to the `main` branch and update the badges accordingly.
This workflow has one job with five steps.
1. Checkout the repository.
2. Download the `cloc` tool.
3. Execute the `cloc.sh` script twice to get the required numbers.
4. Execute the Dynamic Badges Action once to upload the JSON description of the lines-of-code badge.
5. Execute the Dynamic Badges Action once more to upload the JSON description of the comment-percentage badge.

You will have to replace `<gist-ID>` by the ID of the gist you created earlier.
The badge showing the lines of code will have a fixed `lightgrey` color, the comment-percentage badge will have an automatic color: It will be red for 0% comments and green for 50% comments.

{% highlight yml linenos %}{% raw %}
name: Badges

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  update-badges:
    name: Update Badges
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Download cloc
        run: sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y cloc
      - name: Get the Numbers
        run: |
          echo "CODE_LINES=$(   ./cloc.sh --loc)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "COMMENT_PERCENTAGE=$(./cloc.sh --percentage)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Create Lines-of-Code-Badge
        uses: schneegans/dynamic-badges-action@v1.3.0
        with:
          auth: ${{ secrets.GIST_SECRET }}
          gistID: <gist-ID>
          filename: loc.json
          label: Lines of Code
          message: ${{ env.CODE_LINES }}
          color: lightgrey
      - name: Create Comments-Badge
        uses: schneegans/dynamic-badges-action@v1.3.0
        with:
          auth: ${{ secrets.GIST_SECRET }}
          gistID: <gist-ID>
          filename: comments.json
          label: Comments
          message: ${{ env.COMMENT_PERCENTAGE }}%
          valColorRange: ${{ env.COMMENT_PERCENTAGE }}
          maxColorRange: 50
          minColorRange: 0
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Embed the Badges

Once this workflow has run for the first time, you will find new files (`loc.json` and `comments.json` in the example above) in the gist you created before.
Embedding the badges is now straight-forward.

{% highlight markdown %}
     ![loc](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<gist-ID>/raw/loc.json)
![comments](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<gist-ID>/raw/comments.json)
{% endhighlight %}

Shields.io caches the these JSON files for at least 300 seconds, so it may take up to five minutes for your badges to refresh when you re-execute the workflow.

## Final Thoughts

Of course, this cannot be used for lines-of-code badges only.
In fact you can create badges for basically anything which may change from commit to commit!
Let me know if you find another cool use case!
