Out there are several community-made themes for Gnome-Pie. I compiled a page with some themes I found on the web.

## View all the themes!

    <a href="/gnome-pie-themes.html" class="btn-large block"><i class="material-icons left">brush</i>Go to the Themes Gallery</a>
</div>

If you created a theme for Gnome-Pie or spotted one on the internet, feel free to send a link to <a href="mailto:code@simonschneegans.de">code@simonschneegans.de</a> or post the link in the comment section below and I will add the theme to the gallery.
