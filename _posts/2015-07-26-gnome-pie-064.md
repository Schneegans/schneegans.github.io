Due to a regression introduced with the release 0.6.3, a new version of Gnome-Pie had to be released quickly.

## Complete changelog

* **New Feature:** A new theme based on "Adwaita". It features bigger icons than the original theme. This looks awesome with some icon themes (the screenshot above uses [Faenza](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228)).
* **Bugfix:** Fixed missing icon of status icon in message tray.


## Where do I get it?

[Source code snapshots](https://github.com/Simmesimme/Gnome-Pie/tags) can be downloaded directly from github. I also updated my [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~simonschneegans/+archive/ubuntu/testing) for Ubuntu (Trusty & Vivid). Feel free to download it from there!

{% highlight bash %}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:simonschneegans/testing
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gnome-pie
{% endhighlight %}

Or, if you are adventurous, [compile it from source](/gnome-pie.html#toc5)!
