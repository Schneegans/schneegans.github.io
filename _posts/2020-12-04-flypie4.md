I have just released a new version of Fly-Pie. 
This release features localization support, more flexible menu configurations, a way more powerful D-Bus-Interface and other additions!

## What is Fly-Pie?

Fly-Pie is a marking menu for GNOME Shell which can be used to launch applications, insert text, simulate hotkeys, open URLs and much more.
If you haven't already, you can watch the trailer below.

#### New Features
* Fly-Pie has now **localization support**. That means, you can now [translate it to your own language](https://github.com/Schneegans/Fly-Pie#translating-fly-pie)! Pull requests are very welcome (there is also a new **pull request template for translations**!), also for updating the existing translations. Fly-Pie 4 comes with translations for the following languages:
  * English
  * German
  * Italian
* It is now possible to **export or import the menu configuration**.
* A new predefined **System Menu** is now available which shows items for screen-lock, shutdown, settings, etc.
* There is **no differentiation between top-level and submenus anymore**; the items `Top-Level Menu` and `Submenu` are now merged to a `Custom Menu`. This has multiple implications:
  * You can **drag entire menus into other menus** in the menu editor. Or you can make a former submenu to a top-level menu by drag'n'drop.
  * All **predefined menus (`Bookmarks`, `Devices`, etc.) can now be top-level menus** on their own.
  * It's now possible to **reorder menus** in the menu editor.
* The **D-Bus interface of Fly-Pie now supports all action of menu types**. You can open any menu you can configure in the menu editor also via the D-Bus interface. The [README.md](https://github.com/Schneegans/Fly-Pie#fly-pies-d-bus-interface) has been extended to contain a full description of the menu configuration format.
* A **warning is now shown in the settings dialog if GNOME Shell's animations are disabled** (in this case Fly-Pie does not really work). There is a button which can be used to enable the animations.

#### Other Enhancements
* Several new **continuous integration checks** have been added.
  * [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) is run against all scripts.
  * Some error conditions in the scripts are tested.
  * It's tested whether the translations compile successfully.
  * It's tested whether the release zip can be created successfully.
* A lot of the code has been refactored, especially the `ItemRegistry` has been split up so that all action and menu types have their own files now.

#### Acknowledgements
* Many thanks to [daPhipz](https://github.com/daPhipz) for your great contributions!
* Many thanks to [albanobattistella](https://github.com/albanobattistella) for the Italian translation!
