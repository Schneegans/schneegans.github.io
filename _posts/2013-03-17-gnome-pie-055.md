And again: There are some little improvements and bug fixes, but nothing with extraordinary impact.

## Now with git tags

The drag'n'drop between Pies in the editor has been improved a bit. Additionally a major segmentation fault on start up when some icons were not found has been fixed. And the PPA now supports Ubuntu 13.04, Raring Ringtail!

As github removed the possiblity to host snapshot releases, I switched to so called "<em>tags</em>". You can download snapshots of Gnome-Pie's source from this URL: <a href="https://github.com/schneegans/Gnome-Pie/tags" title="https://github.com/schneegans/Gnome-Pie/tags" target="_blank">https://github.com/schneegans/Gnome-Pie/tags</a>.
