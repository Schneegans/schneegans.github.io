Watch the result of another animation project! After finishing Les Formes et les Couleurs we were told to create an animation with Blender.

## Watch the short

A little caterpillar is really hungry and travels the world searching for food. Different objects appear on the caterpillar's way and are eaten by it. The further the caterpillar goes, the more obscure the food becomes and the bigger the caterpillar grows.

## Making of

{% assign picture = "eat-it-04.jpg" %}
{% assign size = "small" %}
{% assign text = "Funny interface of Blender." %}
{% include image.html %}

The film is styled to look like it was drawn by hand, 2D and 3D elements are mixed. A large sphere and an even bigger circle symbolize the Earth and its atmosphere. The "food" as well as the caterpillar are placed on the sphere's surface. An orthographic camera follows the caterpillar's path, constantly zooming out and thus revealing more and more of the Earth's curvature. We used Blender's built­in renderer with [freestyle](http://freestyle.sourceforge.net/) to achieve the hand­drawn look
