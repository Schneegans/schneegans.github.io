It's been a while since my last post. But since I'm planning to release new updates for Gnome-Pie, I decided to create a new homepage! It is now hosted on github pages and built with jekyll. I ported some of the old wordpress posts and managed to import all your comments to disqus.

If you have any remarks regarding the new layout and design of this new website feel free to leave a comment below!

A lot has happened in the meantime --- I've attended the IEEE VR 2014 conference in Minneapolis, nearly finished my master's degree, co-founded a little start-up, created together with some friends of mine the VR-engine [_guacamole_](https://github.com/vrsys) and worked a lot on **M.A.R.S.2** together with Felix.

Stay tuned for more updates!
