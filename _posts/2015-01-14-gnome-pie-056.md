Gnome-Pie is alive! I managed to release a new version of this awesome little pie menu. Of course much has to be done to update Gnome-Pie fully to current software versions (GTK 3.14, Vala 0.27, ...), but for now some important fixes had to be published!

<!--more-->


## What is fixed?

* **Bugfix** Transparency under Gnome 3.10+ (thank you, [RaphaÃ«l Rochet](https://github.com/RaphaelRochet))
* **Bugfix** Pie hotkeys start numbering with one (instead of zero, since the zero key is really hard to press)
* **Bugfix** option windows are now resizable since they are too small with certain window managers (e.g. Gala)

## Where do I get it?

[Source code snapshots](https://github.com/Simmesimme/Gnome-Pie/tags) can be downloaded directly from github. I also updated my [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~simonschneegans/+archive/ubuntu/testing) for Ubuntu (Precise, Trusty &amp; Utopic). Feel free to download it from there!

{% highlight bash %}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:simonschneegans/testing
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gnome-pie
{% endhighlight %}


## What is going to happen next?

I will clean the code within the next days in order to remove all deprecation warnings. Then I plan to drop any GTK2 support --- this step involves porting the old Glade ui-files to current GTK3. Then I will have a look at the current issues filed on github!
