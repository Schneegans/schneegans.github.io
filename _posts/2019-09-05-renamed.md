When I realized that the username **Schneegans** is available on Github, I knew that I had to do something...

## How to redirect Github Pages

When you change your Github username, you are greeted with the following warning (emphasis by me):
<div class="quote">
<ul>
<li>We will not set up redirects for your old profile page.</li>
<li><strong>We will not set up redirects for Pages sites.</strong></li>
<li>We will create redirects for your repositories (web and git access).</li>
<li>Renaming may take a few minutes to complete.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Since there are quite a few websites on the internet linking to pages of my blog, I needed to setup some redirection manually. To do this, I registered a _new_ Github user with my old username **Simmesimme** and created a repository for the Github pages of that new user. Here are the two repositories:

* [https://github.com/simmesimme/simmesimme.github.io](https://github.com/Simmesimme/simmesimme.github.io): The new user account with the old repository name.
* [https://github.com/schneegans/schneegans.github.io](https://github.com/schneegans/schneegans.github.io): The renamed user account with the renamed repository.

When you look at those, you can see that the first repository which will be published to my previous URL ([https://simmesimme.github.io](https://simmesimme.github.io)) contains an html file for each page which existed when I changed my user name. These html files simply redirect to their new location at [https://schneegans.github.io](https://schneegans.github.io).

As there are quite a lot of html files to create, I set up a simple shell script to do this job for me. If you are in a similar situation, this may help you as well!

### The Shell Script & the HTML Template

Let's assume that you have the two repositories cloned next to each other. Let's call them `olduser.github.io` ([simmesimme.github.io](https://github.com/Simmesimme/simmesimme.github.io) in my case) and `renamed.github.io` ([schneegans.github.io](https://github.com/schneegans/schneegans.github.io) in my case). First create a script called `create.sh` and a `template.html.in` file in `olduser.github.io`. In the template you need to insert four times your `renamed.github.io` URL.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script can be used to create a redirection copy of your
# website! It copies a directory structure containing html files from
# $INPUT_DIR to $OUTPUT_DIR. For each html file in $INPUT_DIR, a copy
# of template.html.in is created in $OUTPUT_DIR. Then, all occurences
# of @FILE@ in the template are replaced with the name of the copied
# file.

# The output dir is assumed to be the location of this script.
OUTPUT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "$0" )" && pwd )"
cd $OUTPUT_DIR

# The input dir must be passed as first parameter.
INPUT_DIR="$1"

find $INPUT_DIR -name "*.html" -printf "%P\n" | while read file; do
    mkdir -p $(dirname $file)
    cp template.html.in $file
    sed -i -e "s~@FILE@~$file~g" $file
done
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf8">
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" 
        content="0; url=https://renamed.github.io/@FILE@">
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://renamed.github.io/@FILE@">
  <title>This page has moved</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>    
    This page has moved. Redirecting you to 
    <a href="https://renamed.github.io/@FILE@">
        https://renamed.github.io/@FILE@
    </a>
  </p>
</body>

</html>
```

Then you can execute the script. As an argument you give the path to the jekyll-generated `_site` directory of your `renamed.github.io` repository.

```bash
cd olduser.github.io
chmod +x create.sh
./create.sh ../renamed.github.io/_site
```

That's it! Now you have set-up a redirection page for each html file!
