Today, I present you a new version of Gnome-Pie! There are some bug fixes, a new settings menu layout and a tiny new feature included!

## New setttings menu layout

Since the introduction of [pie shapes]({% post_url 2015-04-18-gnome-pie-061 %}) the settings menu has been somewhat cluttered. It has been hard to discover pie shape options behind the key binding button of each pie. The new layout merges the key binding dialog and the rename dialog into one window which contains all pie settings.

{% assign picture = "gnome-pie_22.jpg" %}
{% assign size = "large" %}
{% assign text = "The new Pie settings dialog." %}
{% include image %}

Here is a before-after-comparison of the old and the new layout. You will spot some differences!

    <div class="row magnific-gallery">
        <div class="col-xs-6">
            {% assign picture = "gnome-pie_20.jpg" %}
            {% assign size = "medium" %}
            {% assign text = "The old Pie design dialog." %}
            {% include gallery_item %}
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-6">
            {% assign picture = "gnome-pie_18.jpg" %}
            {% assign size = "medium" %}
            {% assign text = "The new Pie design dialog." %}
            {% include gallery_item %}
        </div>
    </div>

            {% assign picture = "gnome-pie_21.jpg" %}
            {% assign size = "medium" %}
            {% assign text = "The old general settings dialog." %}
            {% include gallery_item %}
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-6">
            {% assign picture = "gnome-pie_19.jpg" %}
            {% assign size = "medium" %}
            {% assign text = "The new general settings dialog." %}
            {% include gallery_item %}
        </div>
    </div>
</p>

## CSD and new Tab style

This release also features the implementation of Client Side Decorations with the Gtk.HeaderBar and the new Gtk.StackSwitcher. Both are optional and disabled by default because some Gtk-themes do not support them well. You have to start Gnome-Pie from command line to use these new features!

### To use the new HeaderBar:
<p></p>
{% highlight bash %}
gnome-pie --stack-switcher
{% endhighlight %}

### To use the new StackSwitcher:
<p></p>
{% highlight bash %}
gnome-pie --header-bar
{% endhighlight %}

But keep in mind that they will look ugly for some systems, especially with Ubuntu's Unity. Here are some screen shots of other themes using the fall-back layout without CSD or StackSwitchers.

<p>
    <div class="row magnific-gallery">
        <div class="col-xs-6">
            {% assign picture = "gnome-pie_23.jpg" %}
            {% assign size = "medium" %}
            {% assign text = "The new settings menu under Gnome3." %}
            {% include gallery_item %}
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-6">
            {% assign picture = "gnome-pie_24.jpg" %}
            {% assign size = "medium" %}
            {% assign text = "The new settings menu under Unity." %}
            {% include gallery_item %}
        </div>
    </div>
</p>
