This is only a minor maintenance update with not much new content.
It implements some fixes to the build system so that Gnome-Pie can be built with more recent Vala compilers.

The initial version of Gnome-Pie was released about ten years ago!
Now it is merely in low maintenance mode as I am focusing on Fly-Pie, its successor project.

## Complete changelog

* **Improvement:** Updated Italian translation (thank you, [Albano Battistella](https://github.com/albanobattistella)).
* **Improvement:** Updated Dutch translation (thank you, [Heimen Stoffels](https://github.com/Vistaus)).
* **Improvement:** Gnome-Pie now uses window type dialog which should render it above other full screen windows.
* **Bugfix:** Bamf is not required on Wayland anymore.
* **Bugfix:** Fix compiler error on newer Vala compilers.
