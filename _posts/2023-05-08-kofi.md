I have not posted many news on this blog lately. Most of the news are now posted on my new [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/schneegans). I will still post important news here, but if you want to stay up to date, you should follow me on Ko-fi.

So if you want to receive news about Fly-Pie, Burn-My-Windows, or the Desktop Cube, you should follow me on Ko-fi. I will also post news about my other projects there, like my new upcoming cross-platform pie menu.
