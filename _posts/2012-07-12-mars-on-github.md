Just in case you are a fan of the game <a href="http://mars-game.sourceforge.net/">M.A.R.S.</a> and do not check its homepage regularly --- Felix and I managed to port it to the current snapshot of SFML2 and <a href="https://github.com/thelaui/M.A.R.S.">uploaded it to github</a>!

<h2>What's so great about this step?</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> is a platform which allows cooperative development of code with some social aspects. So it's really easy for everyone to take part in the further development of the game and even if Felix and I stop the active development, it's easy for everyone to continue the development.

<h2>What now?</h2>

So head over to <a href="https://github.com/thelaui/M.A.R.S.">its page on github</a> and fork the project and send in many interesting pull requests! We are looking forward to receiving newly implemented features!
