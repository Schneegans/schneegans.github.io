A new release of Gnome-Pie was sent into the wild! There were some little improvements and bug fixes, but nothing with extraordinary impact.

<!--more-->

The changes include:

* **Update** Statistics are not tracked anymore and new users wont be questioned to send the statistics file. I got files by more than 150 users and was able to [write a successful Bachelor thesis]({% post_url 2012-10-10-bachelor-thesis %}).
* **New Feature** A Bulgarian translation has been added. Thanks to Martin Dinov!
* **New Feature** A Chinese translation has been added. Thanks to Ting Zhou!
* **New Feature** It's now possible to drag and drop Slices between Pies in the configuration window.
* **Bugfix** It's now possible to bind Pies to hot keys containing the Super-key (normally referred to as the Windows-key)
* **Bugfix** A possible segmentation fault on start-up has been fixed.
* Ubuntu 12.10 PPA support.

In the meantime I started working on a new project, which will change Gnome-Pie dramatically. It's called OpenPie and you'll hear about it soon...

Until then... stay tuned!
