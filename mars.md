# M.A.R.S.

M.A.R.S. is a ridiculous, open source 2D shooter developed by Felix Lauer and myself. It is a game for two players, flying with ships in a two-dimensional space setting, governed by the laws of gravity. Visit the <a href="http://mars-game.sourceforge.net/">official homepage</a> for more details!
