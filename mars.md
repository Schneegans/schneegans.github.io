title : M.A.R.S - a ridiculous shooter
teaser: mars.jpg
excerpt: M.A.R.S. is a ridiculous, open source 2D shooter which has been developed by Felix Lauer and myself. It is a game for two players, flying with ships in a two-dimensional space setting, governed by the laws of gravity. You can still install it from various sources on the internet, but we do not develop it any further at this point.
