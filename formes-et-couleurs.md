This is a stop motion project done by Felix Lauer and myself for a computer animation class. It has elements of slapstick, the movement is a bit faster than usual and piano sound is used to support the action. It features 927 frames shot with a Canon EOS 450d and the single shots were post-processed and combined to a video clip in Blender.
